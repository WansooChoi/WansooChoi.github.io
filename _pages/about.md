Hello!

I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at the University at Buffalo.

My research focuses on market microstructure, including informed trading, execution quality, and retail trade classification. I am also broadly interested in sophisticated investors such as hedge funds. I look forward to exploring option spreads.
